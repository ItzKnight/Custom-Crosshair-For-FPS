# CrosshairOverlay
Crosshair overlay for FPS Shooters

Instructions:

Installing

Unzip the master.zip by dragging everything out of it onto your desktop (You might need to install 7zip to do this). Once completed, create a folder and call it whatever you want. Now drag the files you dragged onto your desktop into that folder.

Running the program

To run the program, open the folder inside and run the executable (CrosshairOverlay.exe) inside.

Changing the crosshair

If the image is incompatible with your resolution, or you want to change the crosshair, you can use a program like getpaint.net or gimp. (mspaint or any preinstalled windows photo editing software DOES NOT SUPPORT TRANSPARENCY.)
